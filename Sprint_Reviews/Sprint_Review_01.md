# Sprint Review 01

## Andrew Meyer
#### What went well:
I was able to complete my assigned issue on time.
#### What didn't go so well:
It took a lot of time to figure out how to implement such a small feature. Most of that time was spent trying to figure out the organization of the code and figuring out how the relevant Qt components work.
#### What have I learned:
I'm learning my way aroung the Qt documentation. It's a lot of information, but I'm starting to develop a high-level understanding, which is making it easier to zero in on the specific parts I need.
#### What still puzzles me:
Although I was able to figure out enough to complete my issue, I don't fully understand the model/view concept used in Qt. If it's relevant to another issue I work on, I'll be sure to explore it in more depth.
#### What can we change to improve:
We need to continue familiarizing ourselves with Qt and the keepassXC codebase, so future work can go faster.

#### What went well:
For ths first sprint not much went well other then I was able to get my code to compile in time to work on my issues.
#### What didn't go so well:
Attempting to navigate the code without a working debugger made fixing small issues a lot more difficult.
#### What have I learned:
I've learned a bit more on how the Qt interface works and how I can use it along side visual studios to edit the UI interfaces.
#### What still puzzles me:
I still am confused on how I can get my code to properly debug within visual studios, this could be extremely beneficial for future sprints.
#### What can we change to improve:
For the future sprints I am going to work on getting the debugger working so I can decrease time spent on issues exponentially.
