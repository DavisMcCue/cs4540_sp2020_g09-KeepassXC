### What went well?
__Prabesh Poudel:__ 
I was able to make some progress and solve some part of the issue. I was able to
issue warning when the attachment size was greater than 5MB and also when collective
size of database was greater than 50MB.
### What didnâ€™t go so well?
__Prabesh Poudel__: I could not figure out much about cryptomator database. I am 
having hard time writing tests because it is already a big project and I am unable
to perform testing that checks my code. We already have a testing that maintainers
wrote, on which, out of 37 test, 1 fails. This test was also failing when we 
initially built and tested the project.
### What have I learned?
__Prabesh Poudel__: I have learned how to work with cmake to compile and build 
large project with multiple source files, which I haven't had chance to do 
before. Also, I got the chance to learn about git.
### What still puzzles me?
__Prabesh Poudel__: When I was trying to solve the issue, I was trying to find 
one function that handled some operation. I searched for it extensibly but I am 
still not sure where that is. I wanted to learn how to search effectively and I 
am still learning that.
### What will we change to improve?
__Prabesh Poudel__: We will have to include more testing and develop better 
understanding of the project itself.
