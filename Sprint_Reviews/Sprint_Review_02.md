# Sprint Review 02

## Andrew Meyer
#### What went well:
I was able to complete my issue and gained some more insight into the organization of the codebase.
#### What didn't go so well:
Existing unit tests don't touch any of the code I modified, and I didn't have time to add any myself.
I was only able to manually test my changes.
#### What have I learned:
I have a better understanding of how system settings are stored and accessed, as well as how to work with ui elements.
I also now understand how the application handles settings which have been deprecated or had their internal names changed.
#### What still puzzles me:
I'm still familiarizing myself with the automated tests, and what exactly they cover.
So far, none of the changes I've made have caused tests to fail, so it seems the tests don't cover everything.
Of those, I think my changes to the deprecation/upgrade function are worth unit testing, 
but I'm still not very familiar with how this project handles testing.
#### What can we change to improve:
Get more comfortable with the existing automatic tests so I can quickly add them for future changes, 
especially as I start working on more significant issues.

## Brad Puthoff
#### What went well:
I was able to complete my intial issue I begun looking at last sprint (Duplicated entries in the Key File dropdown list). I was able to complete this after I had enough time to analyze the code and begin to understand the organization and naming conventions being used.
#### What didn't go so well:
I was still struggling with getting my debugger up and running within visual studios. I also attempted at using CLion, but I will need to seek further help to get this working.
#### What have I learned:
I learned more about the naming conventions being used for different variables and objects.
#### What still puzzles me:
I am still trying to get better at navigating the code without a debugger. Finding were certain processes are taking place seems to be the majority of my time spent when working on these issues as of now.
#### What can we change to improve:
Continuing to understand the layout of the open source code and finding some help to get a debugger working.

## Prabesh Poudel

#### What went well?
The program no longer crashes when provided with invalid URL.
#### What didn’t go so well?
I had to spend more than the estimated time to fix the issue.
#### What have I learned?
Even experienced programmer such as the maintainers of this project may sometimes
fail to understand how a function from a framework works, leading to very strange
and weird runtime error. I have learned that if I cannot find any bug after searching
for hours, I would have to verify the results from frameworks.
#### What still puzzles me?
I am trying to find a way to quickly compile and test the application which currently
takes around 3-4 minutes to build.
#### What will we change to improve?
I need to start using debugger tools to efficiently debug the program.

## Davis McCue
#### What went well?
I was able to finally get my project to compile correctly and build and test my changes. I am going to update the windows installer page to make less confusing and easier to follow.

#### What didn’t go so well?
Trying to find where code over-laps and correctly add my code to chage the way something works.

#### What have I learned?
I have learned how to further navigate around their code and some what understand how their code works.

#### What still puzzles me?
What software they are using to create and work the ui folders within keepass.
Why my clion build is crashing now and I havent done anything and now it deleted my work so, I dont understand why.

#### What will we change to improve?
I need to try to learn their code and program even further and understand how things connect because when you dig deeper there code can get a bit confusing.
