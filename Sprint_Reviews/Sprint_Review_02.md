# Sprint Review 01

## Andrew Meyer
#### What went well:
I was able to complete my assigned issue on time.
#### What didn't go so well:
It took a lot of time to figure out how to implement such a small feature. Most of that time was spent trying to figure out the organization of the code and figuring out how the relevant Qt components work.
#### What have I learned:
I'm learning my way aroung the Qt documentation. It's a lot of information, but I'm starting to develop a high-level understanding, which is making it easier to zero in on the specific parts I need.
#### What still puzzles me:
Although I was able to figure out enough to complete my issue, I don't fully understand the model/view concept used in Qt. If it's relevant to another issue I work on, I'll be sure to explore it in more depth.
#### What can we change to improve:
We need to continue familiarizing ourselves with Qt and the keepassXC codebase, so future work can go faster.

## Brad Puthoff
#### What went well:
For ths first sprint not much went well other then I was able to get my code to compile in time to work on my issues.
#### What didn't go so well:
Attempting to navigate the code without a working debugger made fixing small issues a lot more difficult.
#### What have I learned:
I've learned a bit more on how the Qt interface works and how I can use it along side visual studios to edit the UI interfaces.
#### What still puzzles me:
I still am confused on how I can get my code to properly debug within visual studios, this could be extremely beneficial for future sprints.
#### What can we change to improve:
For the future sprints I am going to work on getting the debugger working so I can decrease time spent on issues exponentially.

## Prabesh Poudel

#### What went well?
I was able to make some progress and solve some part of the issue. I was able to
issue warning when the attachment size was greater than 5MB and also when collective
size of database was greater than 50MB.
#### What didn’t go so well?
I had to break down the original issue into two different parts because there were
multiple issues some of which required deeper understanding of the codebase.
#### What have I learned?
I have learned how to work with cmake to compile and build 
large project with multiple source files, which I haven't had chance to do 
before. Also, I got the chance to learn about git.
#### What still puzzles me?
It is so confusing to track the work flow of the program because of its mature and
large code
base.
#### What will we change to improve?
We will have to include more testing and develop better 
understanding of the project itself.

## Davis McCue
#### What went well?
I was able to make some progress by adding a Sort function that took a password that was deleted 
and add a date to it in the recycling bin and that way the sort function will be able to sort it.
where old passwords are at the bottom and new deleted passwords are at the top.
#### What didn’t go so well?
Getting the command line to properly work is still an issue. The only thing that I can do at the 
moment is use the search function to navigate through the code to find where code links up but, testing 
is a big issue because I cant compile and run the code. 
#### What have I learned?
I have learn how to effectively search through VS code and pin-point certain code that I want to trace. I have 
also learned how to use git and gitbash. I have learned how to use cmake more. But, this project is a work in progress 
and there much, much more too learn.
#### What still puzzles me?
I still don't understand why the command line and cmake arent working together. I don't know if the path is corrupted or 
something else. Still trying to figure it out.
#### What will we change to improve?
make more test for our code that we implement into their already standing code. Make sure to get our IDE constantly working 
all the time and not here and there like they are now.
