## Brad Puthoff
#### What went well:
I was able to complete my intial issue I begun looking at last sprint (Duplicated entries in the Key File dropdown list). I was able to complete this after I had enough time to analyze the code and begin to understand the organization and naming conventions being used.
#### What didn't go so well:
I was still struggling with getting my debugger up and running within visual studios. I also attempted at using CLion, but I will need to seek further help to get this working.
#### What have I learned:
I learned more about the naming conventions being used for different variables and objects.
#### What still puzzles me:
I am still trying to get better at navigating the code without a debugger. Finding were certain processes are taking place seems to be the majority of my time spent when working on these issues as of now.
#### What can we change to improve:
Continuing to understand the layout of the open source code and finding some help to get a debugger working.

## Prabesh Poudel

#### What went well?
The program no longer crashes when provided with invalid URL.
#### What didn’t go so well?
I had to spend more than the estimated time to fix the issue.
#### What have I learned?
Even experienced programmer such as the maintainers of this project may sometimes
fail to understand how a function from a framework works, leading to very strange
and weird runtime error. I have learned that if I cannot find any bug after searching
for hours, I would have to verify the results from frameworks.
#### What still puzzles me?
I am trying to find a way to quickly compile and test the application which currently
takes around 3-4 minutes to build.
#### What will we change to improve?
I need to start using debugger tools to efficiently debug the program.
